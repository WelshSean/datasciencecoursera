# Q1
Consider the mtcars data set. Fit a model with mpg as the outcome that includes number of cylinders as a factor variable and weight as confounder. Give the adjusted estimate for the expected change in mpg comparing 8 cylinders to 4.

```{r}
data("mtcars")
library(dplyr)
#mtcars <- subset(mtcars, cyl %in% c(4, 8))
mtcars <- mutate(mtcars, cyl = 1 * (cyl == 4)) # create binary variable
fit <- lm(mpg ~ cyl+wt, mtcars )
fit$coefficients
```
