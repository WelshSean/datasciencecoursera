# Q1

```{r}
#Consider the following data with x as the predictor and y as as the outcome.
#
#x <- c(0.61, 0.93, 0.83, 0.35, 0.54, 0.16, 0.91, 0.62, 0.62)
#y <- c(0.67, 0.84, 0.6, 0.18, 0.85, 0.47, 1.1, 0.65, 0.36)
#Give a P-value for the two sided hypothesis test of whether Î²1 from a linear regression model is 0 or not.
x <- c(0.61, 0.93, 0.83, 0.35, 0.54, 0.16, 0.91, 0.62, 0.62)
y <- c(0.67, 0.84, 0.6, 0.18, 0.85, 0.47, 1.1, 0.65, 0.36)
 z <- lm(y ~ x)
 summary(z)
 
 #p-value
```

# Q2
```{r}
# Consider the previous problem, give the estimate of the residual standard deviation.
#Residual standard error
```

# Q3
```{r}
# In the mtcars data set, fit a linear regression model of weight (predictor) on mpg #(outcome). Get a 95% confidence interval for the expected mpg at the average weight. #What is the lower endpoint?
```
